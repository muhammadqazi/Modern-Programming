# TERM ASSIGNMENT

Write a complete Python program which will perform the following:

1.       A method called modify(stdid, field, new_value) which will modify the requested field to the provided new value of the given student.

2.       An insert(stdid,name,cgpa,date,gender) method which will append a student to the end of the student file.

3.       A delete(stdid) method which will delete a student record (line) completely.

4.       display() which will display all students on the monitor (tab separated).

5.       A method called stats() which will create a new file called stats.txt in the same path of the students.txt which will contain how many female and male students there are, the average cgpa and the total student count on separate lines.

 

As a test, perform the following in the main function:

1.       Display all students on the monitor

2.       Modify Tom Jennings cgpa to 2.12

3.       Add a new student called Tom Jones with id number 2341, cgpa 3.1, date of birth 12-08-1991, gender M

4.       Delete the student Bart Simpson from the file

5.       Display all students on the monitor (this time you should see the modifications)
